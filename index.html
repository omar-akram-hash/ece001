    <p><big>AI has been consistently one of the biggest tech trends over the past half decade, and as the marketing saturation for AI continues, the buzzwords can become overwhelming. However, within AI software, G2 Crowd has determined a few trends within the trend: embedded AI and machine learning as a service (MLaaS).
Embedded AI â€” Machine and deep learning functionality is becoming embedded in nearly all types of software,

 whether the user is aware of it or not. The use of embedded AI inside software like CRM, marketing automation,
  and analytics solutions is allowing users to streamline processes, automate certain tasks,
   and gain a competitive edge with predictive capabilities. 
   Embedded AI will only pick up in the coming years in a similar fashion to the way cloud deployment and mobile capabilities have over the past decade or so. Eventually, it will be so commonplace that vendors will not need to highlight the fact that their product benefits from machine learning; 
it will just be assumed and expected.</big></p>

        <p><big>While many employees probably interact with intelligent applications, the users of AI software are primarily software engineers who use the tools to build those intelligent applications. It takes a high knowledge of machine learning and software development to fully utilize AI software. There is a significant gap in the need for machine learning developers and the number of qualified candidates. Many larger companies offer high wages to those who can build machine learning algorithms or have the knowledge to train deep learning models.
         Despite the demand and lucrative salaries, there is still a general shortage of those who can take advantage of AI software.
Similarly, there is a shortage in data scientists, another position that may use AI software. 
Data scientists are not necessarily developing intelligent applications, 
but instead using machine learning models to extract actionable insights from data. Most frequently, these employees would take advantage of predictive analytics or natural language processing, among other AI software features, to pull valuable business insights from company data. Many businesses will also pay a large salary for data scientists as their value becomes increasingly higher due to the amount of data companies are consuming.</big></p>

    <p><big>Artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually been making its way into business software and will continue to for the foreseeable future. These intelligent applications have incorporated machine and deep learning algorithms into their everyday functionality to better automate tasks for the user. Automating these processes saves the user time and energy, makes their job simpler, and allows employees to work more efficiently and productively. While there are some that believe AI is out to replace their jobs, they will be pleasantly surprised that, in most cases, this is a false assumption. Instead, the application of AI will simply make their jobs easier. For the developers interested in building their own intelligent applications, the AI platforms, machine learning algorithms, 
    and deep learning libraries and frameworks used to create such functionality are found in the following subcategories.</big></p>

    <p><big>The most prominent definitions of psychologists for intellgence according to job include the following:
        Terman : he defined intelligence as the ability to perform abstract thought.
         Colvin: IQ is the individual's access to the stage of ability to learn.
        Stern: is the general ability of the individual to adapt mentally with new situations and life problems.
        Jordad: Jordan knew intelligence as the ability to use previous experiences and use them to solve the problems present, in addition to predicting and anticipating future problems that may be exposed to the individual.
        Harod Gardens: Intelligence is the level of intellectual competence of the individual that consists of a set of skills that enable the individual to use them to solve problems and acquire new knowledge.
        artificial intelligence
        In the mid-1980s, researchers developed computers capable of making some decisions based on solutions to pre-programmed problems. However, developers failed to exploit this invention in practical applications, and with the continued technological progress, computers were able to learn and solve problems autonomously. 1997 man was defeated for the first time in chess by computer. The continuous inventions and improvements prompted artificial intelligence to become today an urgent need and an effective indispensable means.</big></p>
